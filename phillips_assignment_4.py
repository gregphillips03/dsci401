'''
The following transformations were made to the data outside of the work environment:

- The data set contained the column 'Date of Incident', which was renamed to 'Month'
- Each record contained the specific calendar day which the incident occurred. These fields were mapped
to the corresponding month of the year, as a text label; i.e., 03/04/2017 became 'March'. 

- Changed 'Worker Type' WHERE value == 'Contractor/Subcontractor (Managed)'
- Replaced 1040 locations with 'Contractor'

- Changed 'Worker Type' WHERE value == 'Contractor/Subcontractor (Unmanaged)'
- Replaced 1316 locations with 'Contractor'

The following records were removed from the data set:

- The data set contains more than 'AECOM Employees' and 'Contractors'. It also contains joint venture
partners, as well as members of the public. 

- Removed records WHERE value of 'Worker Type' == 'JV Partner'. 
- Removed a total of 6 records. 

- Removed records WHERE value of 'Worker Type' == 'Third Party/Public'. 
- Removed a total of 38 records.
